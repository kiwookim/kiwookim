- 👋 Hi, I’m Ki Woo, full-stack engineer
- 👀 I’m currently interested in expanding my knowledge in JavaScript frameworks and Java
- 🌱 I studied full-stack development @ App Academy
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that solve real-world problems.

As a full-stack software engineer, I have enjoyed using React/Redux, Node/Express, and Python for the backend with Flask. With those technologies, I have built E-commerce and social media website solo and with fellow engineers.
In my free time, I enjoy cycling and listening to music.
